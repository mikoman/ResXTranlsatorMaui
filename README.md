# ResXTranlsator
 A simple UI based resx file translator

Currently using DeepL api to translate into hardcoded options of languages (Based on my needs) This can easily adapted to use any languages. 
Also exports to an excel sheet. This is a personal project but I thought it might be useful for people not on windows trying to translate resx. 
Will add google translate api support as well soon.
