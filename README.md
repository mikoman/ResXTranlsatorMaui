# ResXTranlsator
 A simple UI based resx file translator

Currently using DeepL api to translate into hardcoded options of languages (Based on my needs) This can easily adapted to use any languages. 
Also exports to an excel sheet. This is a personal project but I thought it might be useful for people not on windows trying to translate resx. 
Will add google translate api support as well soon. 


Inspired by 

https://github.com/HakanL/resxtranslator
https://github.com/stevencohn/ResxTranslator
https://github.com/DamienDoumer/Resx-Translator

Note this is not as exhausting in the options and as detailed as I just needed a straight up translation. Also the reason I did not use the existing repos is that
I am developing on MacOs and porting 4.x to 6 would take much longer than this simple translator.
