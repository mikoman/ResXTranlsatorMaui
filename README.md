# ResXTranslator

ResXTranslator is a straightforward and UI-based .resx file translator designed for simplicity and efficiency. While its core functionality is tailored to specific needs, it can be effortlessly adapted to support a broader range of languages or additional features.

## Features

- Utilizes the **DeepL API** for translations.
- Exports translations to an Excel sheet.
- Support for multiple languages (easy to extend).

ðŸ”œ **Coming Soon:** Google Translate API integration!

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by some great tools available on GitHub:

- [resxtranslator by HakanL](https://github.com/HakanL/resxtranslator)
- [ResxTranslator by stevencohn](https://github.com/stevencohn/ResxTranslator)
- [Resx-Translator by DamienDoumer](https://github.com/DamienDoumer/Resx-Translator)

However, while the existing tools offer a wide array of features, I needed a more streamlined solution. The primary motivator was the development environment on MacOS, where porting from .NET 4.x to .NET 6 would be more time-consuming than creating this focused translator.

## Note to Users

This is a personal project, designed primarily for my needs. If you're seeking a comprehensive solution, you might want to explore other options. But if you're looking for a quick and efficient translator that works seamlessly on MacOS, give ResXTranslator a try!
